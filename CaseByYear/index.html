	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p>We present an information visualization system for data of Notifiable diseases in the United States for the last 122 years. Our system uses various information visualization techniques to show user the prevalence of diseases from 1928-2003; the spatial and temporal variables of the data were taken into account while developing the system and importance was given to make sure than user can generate insights from the visualization. Our system provides comparisons for clinical studies and it can be used to assess costs of health care and validate historic events whether they had an impact on the trend line of the disease outbreak or not. The solution we present explores the data using multiple views, offering the users both a holistic view of the diseases and a microscopic level view of the diseases. </p>
